### Dataset
The 1000 images are from the NIPS 2017 ImageNet-Compatible dataset.   
[official repository](https://github.com/cleverhans-lab/cleverhans/tree/master/cleverhans_v3.1.0/examples/nips17_adversarial_competition/dataset) or   
[Zhao's Github](https://github.com/ZhengyuZhao/Targeted-Tansfer/tree/main/dataset).   
A merit of this dataset is a pseudo-random list of target labels is provided. Such setting eliminates arbitrariness in selecting attack targets, which may lead to unfair comparisons.
